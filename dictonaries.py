# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

dic = {
    'Harry': 'Huming Being',
    'Spon': 'Object'
}
print(dic)
print(type(dic))

dict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(dict)

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
